About
--------------------------------------------------------
A Credit Default Swap (CDS) is a financial swap agreement between two
counterparties in which the buyer pays a fixed periodic coupon to the
seller in exchange for protection in the case of a credit event. The
International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) has created a
set of standard terms for CDS contracts, the so-called ''Standard
Model.'' This allows market participants to calculate cash settlement
from conventional spread quotations, convert between conventional
spread and upfront payments, and build the yield curve of a CDS. 

The **creditr** package provides an open-source implementation of the ISDA 
Standard Model in `R`. It allows users, such as credit risk 
modelers and academic researchers, to value CDS contracts and compute various 
associated risk measures. This package serves as a bridge between the opaque 
mechanics of CDS pricing and a transparent implementation of it. Please note 
that the **creditr** `R` package is a wrapper around ISDA's standard CDS model 
in `C++`.

You can find the package on CRAN at [https://cran.r-project.org/package=creditr](https://cran.r-project.org/package=creditr)

                  RED      = NULL,
                  date     = as.Date("2014-05-27"),
                  spread   = 50,
                  maturity = NULL,
                  tenor    = 5,
                  coupon   = 100,
                  recovery = 0.4,
                  currency = "USD",
